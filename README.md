# Pedestrian Level-of-Service (PLOS) and Walkability Equity in Saskatoon: A Gender-Based and Health Analysis 

Patricia Salazar-Ramirez, Meisam Ghasedi, Daniel Fuller

### Research Questions
1.	How does pedestrian infrastructure quality, measured by the Pedestrian Level-of-Service (PLOS), relate to walking behavior across Saskatoon?<br>
    a) Do these patterns differ by gender?<br>
2.	How do PLOS and walking rate relate to diabetes in each dissemination area (DA)? <br>

### Rationale and Significance
Walking is a core determinant of health and the foundation of sustainable cities. However, disparities in pedestrian infrastructure often reflect social inequalities, especially differences in mobility, safety, and comfort1. Pedestrian Level-of-Service (PLOS) is one of the most widely used metrics for assessing the overall quality of the walking environment2. However, traditional PLOS models prioritize infrastructure measurements but rarely account for who benefits from improved pedestrian environments or how these experiences differ across populations3,4.<br>

This proposed research will evaluate a Pedestrian Level-of Service measurement by dissemination area (DA) in Saskatoon, using three variables: sidewalk width, class, and material. It will also address gaps in existing literature by applying a sex- and gender-based analysis (GBA+) to the spatial assessment of pedestrian environments, identifying potential inequities in infrastructure quality and walking behavior. Finally, the study will compare PLOS results with the Canadian Active Living Environment (Can-ALE) index, an indicator of neighborhood walkability, to examine how micro-scale infrastructure conditions align with broader environmental characteristics that support active living.<br> 

By integrating infrastructure data, gender-stratified walking behavior, and an environmental index, this research will contribute to Healthy and Smart Cities paradigms, using geographic data to guide equitable urban design.<br>

### Objectives
1.	To develop a PLOS model using municipal spatial data on sidewalk characteristics in Saskatoon.<br>
2.	To validate the PLOS measure using walking rates (walk share).<br>
3.	To assess the spatial relationship between PLOS scores, walking rate, gender, and diabetes within a Healthy Cities and Smart Cities framework. <br>

### Methodological Framework
This research design combines several methods from the course:<br>
•	Socio-Spatial Epidemiology: to identify geographic disparities in pedestrian infrastructure and walking behavior using spatial analysis at the DA level.<br>
•	Gender-Based Analysis (GBA+): to examine how gender influences access to pedestrian infrastructure and walking behaviors.<br>
•	Data Science and Methods Modeling: to develop and validate a PLOS scoring system using spatial data and computational analysis in R.<br>
•	Healthy Cities and Smart Cities Frameworks: to frame PLOS as an equity indicator for sustainable, health-promoting urban environments.<br>

### Methods
•	Study area: Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.<br>
•	Data sources:<br>
o	City of Saskatoon open data (sidewalks, roads, paths).<br>
o	Statistics Canada 2021 Census (walking mode share by gender and DA).<br>
o	Administrative health data (diabetic patients in Saskatoon from 1995 to 2010). <br>
<br>
•	Analysis plan:<br>
o	Develop a PLOS scoring framework incorporating sidewalk width, class, and material.<br>
o	Weight segment scores by length and normalize by DA area to create a continuous PLOS density variable.<br>
o	Map PLOS values and classify DAs into four categories: Low, Medium, High, Very High.<br>
o	Validate the PLOS score using walk rate.<br>
o	Stratify walking rates by gender and analyze correlations between PLOS and gendered walking behavior.<br>
o	Join Can-ALE data to DAs, comparing with PLOS classifications.<br>

### Expected Contributions 
This study will develop a Pedestrian Level-of-Service (PLOS) measure, integrating socio-spatial epidemiology, GBA+, and data science to evaluate walkability equity in Saskatoon. The analysis will generate evidence on inequities in pedestrian infrastructure and walking behavior, highlighting which neighborhoods face the greatest barriers to active mobility.<br>

	The findings will be shared with City of Saskatoon planners and public health stakeholders to inform local infrastructure decisions. The goal is to translate the analysis into practical insights that can guide investments directed at improving sidewalk quality, connectivity, and accessibility, ultimately promoting more active, healthy and inclusive communities. <br>
